The dataset was too large to process within a reasonable time and memory constraints, making it impractical for our needs. Consequently, we decided to reduce the dataset size by selecting a representative sample. Specifically, we chose to use 24% of the total dataset, ensuring that this subset includes an even distribution of 4% from each of the six labels. This approach allows us to maintain the diversity and balance of the original dataset while significantly reducing the computational resources required for analysis.

We used 20 samples for the N-BaIoT dataset and 50 samples for the mems dataset.
